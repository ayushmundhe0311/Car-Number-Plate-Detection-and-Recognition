## **Methodology**
1. **Dataset Preparation**:
   - A dataset of 900 car images was collected, each featuring a clearly visible number plate.
   - Bounding box annotations were created in a CSV format, specifying the coordinates of the number plates.
   - A script converted these annotations into individual TXT files, compatible with YOLOv8's training format.
   - The dataset was divided into training and validation sets, organized into appropriate directories for model training.

2. **Number Plate Detection**:
   - YOLOv8, a state-of-the-art object detection model, was trained on the prepared dataset.
   - The trained model was used to detect and localize number plates within input images.
   - Detected number plates were saved for further processing.

3. **Number Plate Recognition**:
   - The EasyOCR library was employed to extract the text from the detected number plates.
   - EasyOCRâ€™s optical character recognition capabilities were utilized to recognize characters and digits accurately.
